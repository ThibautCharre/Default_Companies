## Algo for credit scoring

## Road map
1/ Importing dataset
2/ Cleaning dataset and missing values
3/ Feature engineering phase
4/ Machine Learning algorithms predictions
5/ Selecting the best algo and optimising its hyperparameters

## Description
The project aims at detecting companies that are most likely to default.
Machine learning algorithms are imported and predictive scores are calculated and compared 
to select the most efficient and reliable model.
The original dataset consists of financial variables issued from financial reports of companies
and a labeled variable (X_65) indicating the default event (1) or the non-default (0) of a company.
